Role: Act as a Lead Frontend Engineer and UI/UX Architect.

Goal: Build a production-ready, modular React application called "Word Lab", an advanced text analysis tool.

Technical Constraints & Stack:

Framework: React.
Styling: Tailwind CSS (responsive, mobile-first).
Icons: Lucide-React.
State Management: React Hooks (useState/useMemo).
Persistence: `localStorage` for automatic draft saving.
Default Theme: Light Mode (with a toggle for Dark Mode).

Architecture Requirements:

1. Modular Components: Separate UI into `Header`, `StatsGrid`, `Editor`, `ControlBar`, and `KeywordBadge`.
2. Custom Hook: Create `useTextAnalyzer` to handle all logic (word counts, reading time, transformations).
3. Accessibility: Use semantic HTML (`<main>`, `<header>`, `aria-labels`).

Feature Specifications:

1. The Editor: A focus-mode textarea with auto-resizing and custom scrollbar styling.
2. The Stats Column:

Basic: Words, Characters (with/without spaces), Sentences, and Paragraphs.
Advanced: Reading Level: Calculate Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level using the standard formula: 

Tooltip: On hovering over the Grade score, show a popup explaining how the grade is calculated.
Time: Estimated Reading Time (225 wpm) and Speaking Time (150 wpm).
Lexical Density: Unique words vs. total words percentage.

3. Text Transformers: Buttons for UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case, and a Format button (removes extra spaces/breaks).
4. UX Utilities: "Copy to Clipboard" with a visual toast/success confirmation.

Deliverables Required:

1. Project Structure: A tree view of the folder hierarchy.
2. Full Source Code: Provide complete, non-omitted code for:

`useTextAnalyzer.js` (Include the full syllable counting logic and Flesch-Kincaid math).
`App.jsx` (Main layout integrating the search and theme logic).
`StatsDisplay.jsx` (The component with hover-based formula explanations).
`index.css` (Tailwind directives and custom UI tweaks).
